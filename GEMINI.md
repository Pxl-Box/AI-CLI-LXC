# GEMINI Mandates - AI Terminal Workspace (AI-CLI-LXC)

This directory is the primary workspace for maintaining and extending the web-based terminal interface for AI CLIs.

## Memory & Context Workflow
- **Commit to Memory:** When the "Commit to Memory" button is clicked, it sends an instruction to update the current workspace's `GEMINI.md` file. 
- **AI Action:** The AI must respond by summarizing the progress made during the session, identifying any new project-specific mandates, and updating the file to ensure continuity across future sessions.
- **Hierarchical Memory:** Always prioritize updating the most specific `GEMINI.md` file (the one in the active workspace directory) over more general parent or global context files.

## Key Files & Directories
- `server.js`: The core Express/Node.js server handling PTY and static file serving.
- `public/`: Frontend React/Vanilla JS assets for the terminal UI.
- `scripts/`: (`install.sh`, `proxmox-create-lxc.sh`, `setup-lxc.sh`) Deployment and configuration scripts.
- `package.json`: Dependency management for the Node.js environment.

## Workspace Mandates
- **Stability:** Ensure all changes to `server.js` or deployment scripts are thoroughly tested for regressions, especially regarding terminal sizing and shell execution.
- **Security:** Maintain strict isolation between the web terminal and the host system. Validate all file path operations from the UI.
- **UX Consistency:** The terminal UI must remain minimal, high-performance, and focused on AI development workflows.

## Development Workflow
1. **Testing:** Run `npm install` and `node server.js` to test UI changes locally on `http://localhost:3000`.
2. **Deployment:** Update shell scripts only after confirming manual installation steps on a clean Ubuntu 24.04 environment.
3. **PTE Management:** When modifying `node-pty` logic, ensure correct handling of window resizing events to prevent visual artifacts.
